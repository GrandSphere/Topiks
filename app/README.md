## Priorty 0
Fix:[l] Chatscreen GUI 
Fix:[dl] Integrate search for different windows (Topics, Messages, both)

## Priorty 1
Fix: Auto Scroll messages
Feature: Add error handling. App should not crash so often. Rather give errors. Big issue is if table changed, user cannot backup.
Fix: Image types only should be allowed for Topic Icon
Fix: Copying files should rename previous file and keep both. Current implementation Does not allow saving 2 files with different names. Alternate solutions is making a new folder for each message topic or day

## Priorty 2
Fix: Allow editing a topic
Feature: Open files on click

## Priorty 3
